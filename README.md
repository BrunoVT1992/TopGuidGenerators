## Why GUIDsGenerator?

Because sometimes you just need a GUID.  
And sometimes you need **500,000 of them**.  
And sometimes you want them **formatted just right**.

**GUIDsGenerator.com** is a modern, browser-based **GUID / UUID generator** built for developers who want prefer an easy and fast to use tool that is completely RFC complaint.

### Highlights

- ✅ **True GUID / UUID generator** (RFC compliant)
- ✅ Supports **UUID v4** (random) and **UUID v7** (time-ordered)
- ✅ Generate **single or bulk GUIDs** (up to hundreds of thousands)
- ✅ Runs **100% client-side** — nothing is sent or stored
- ✅ Multiple formats:
  - Hyphenated / non-hyphenated
  - Uppercase / lowercase
  - Braces, parentheses
  - Base64 & URL-safe encodings
- ✅ One-click copy, instant results
- ✅ Free. Fast. Forever.

## What Makes This Different?

There are many GUID tools. Most fall into one of these categories:

| Tool | What it does | Limitations |
|----|----|----|
| **GUIDsGenerator.com** | **Real GUIDs, online, instantly** | None 😌 |
| **CuteUID** | Generates “cute” IDs | Fun, but **not production GUIDs** |
| **Vanity-UUID** | CLI vanity UUIDs | Requires install, slow, niche |
| **MiniGUID** | Shortened GUIDs | Non-standard, ecosystem-specific |

GUIDsGenerator.com focuses on **standards, speed and usability** — not novelty formats that break compatibility.

## GUID/UUID Inspector
https://www.guidsgenerator.com/inspect

Think of it as X-ray vision for GUIDs – instantly see what's inside that 128-bit string! Just paste a GUID/UUID and the tool will *“detect, decode and decompile”* it – revealing the version, variant, timestamp, node ID and more. The Inspector supports all GUID / UUID versions (v1–v8) and runs fully in your browser (no data is ever sent out).

**Key features:**  
- Detects version/variant and breaks out fields (timestamp, node, etc).  
- Accepts GUID / UUID formats with or without hyphens/braces or a `urn:uuid:`.  
- Supports all UUID versions (1–8) and runs entirely in-browser (no API calls or data uploads).  

**Example:** Paste `6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8` (a v1 UUID) and the inspector will display *Version 1* (time-based) with a decoded timestamp and node. 
Pasting a random v4 like `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479` would yield *Version 4* (random, no timestamp). 
This makes the inspector great for verifying or understanding any GUID you encounter.

## What Is a GUID / UUID?

A **GUID** (Globally Unique Identifier) or **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value designed to be unique across space and time.

Example: 7e760907-099b-41d9-83f7-c290dc6f059a


They are commonly used for:

- Database primary keys
- Distributed systems
- Event sourcing
- Correlation IDs
- APIs
- Logs
- Anything that must *never collide*

Yes, the collision probability is *absurdly small*.

## GUID vs UUID — Are They the Same?

Short answer: **yes**.

- GUID = Microsoft terminology
- UUID = RFC terminology

In practice, they refer to the **same 128-bit identifier**.

If you searched for:
- “guid generator”
- “uuid generator”
- “online guid”
- “generate uuid”

You’re in the right place.

## Supported UUID Versions

### UUID v4 — Random
- Cryptographically strong randomness
- Most widely used
- Ideal for general purposes

### UUID v7 — Time-Ordered (Modern & Fast)
- Newer standard (RFC 9562)
- Sortable by time
- Better database index locality
- Perfect for high-write systems

GUIDsGenerator supports **both**, because modern systems deserve modern IDs.

## Generate GUIDs in Any Language

You can generate GUIDs anywhere — but this site is often faster 😄

### JavaScript
```js
crypto.randomUUID();
```

### C#
```
Guid.NewGuid();
```

### PowerShell
```
[guid]::NewGuid()
```

### Python
```
import uuid
uuid.uuid4()
```

## GUID/UUID Wiki (Reference)
https://www.guidsgenerator.com/wiki

The **GUID/UUID Wiki** on [guidsgenerator.com/wiki](https://www.guidsgenerator.com/wiki) is like a friendly, comprehensive guide to everything about these unique identifiers. It starts with the basics and then dives into details: separate sections for each version, tables comparing version features, explanations of terms, answers to frequently asked questions and so much more. For example, it clarifies that “GUID vs UUID” is mostly terminology (Microsoft vs standards), and it outlines when GUIDs are a good fit (e.g. distributed systems, offline apps) versus when simpler keys might suffice.

In short, it’s a go-to reference for any developer (or curious user) who needs to crack the GUID/UUID code.
